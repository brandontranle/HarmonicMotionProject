# Harmonic Motion Project for Summer 2023 Phys 1A @ UCLA
This study examines the validity of scientific computing when replicating real-world physics scenarios. In particular, the research observes a harmonic simulation built with Javascript and HTML, 
stylized in CSS, and compares the results of scenarios within the simulation to a study by Warawut Sukmak, who examined the real-time graphing of a mass-spring system given initial variables. 

The objective of this study is to create an Harmonic Motion simulator with real-time recording of each oscillation interval, and to test whether or not real-world experiments can be replicated and 
essentially replace the physical mass-spring system itself. This experiment was run under Mozilla Firefoxâ€™s Developer browser as it is well known for its optimization in web development. Additionally, the program was run under a Ryzen 5 3600 that operates at 3.6 GHz, which is important to note since rerunning this simulation with the exact variables may vary differently on other browsers and computer components.
